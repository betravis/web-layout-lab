    <p>It also adds shape-margin and shape-padding to offset the content from the shape's edge.</p>

<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."</p>

<p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. "There's plenty of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>

<p>"Have some wine," the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p>

<p>Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. "I don't see any wine," she remarked.</p>

<p>"There isn't any," said the March Hare.</p>

<p>"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," said Alice angrily.</p>

<p>"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited," said the March Hare.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was your table," said Alice; "it's laid for a great many more than three."</p>

<p>"Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.</p>

<p>"You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with some severity: "it's very rude."</p>
 
<p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"</p>

<p>"Come, we shall have some fun now!" thought Alice, "I'm glad they've begun asking riddles &mdash; I believe I can guess that," she added aloud.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said the March Hare.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on.</p>

<p>"I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least &mdash; at least I mean what I say&mdash;that's the same thing, you know."</p>

<p>"Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter. "Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!"</p>

<p>"You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that 'I like what I get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!"</p>

<p>"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I sleep when I breathe'!"</p>
