#Layout Lab Exercises for MAX 2013

These exercises demonstrate some new layout features currently under development. In order to view these, you will need to be running Chrome Canary with 'Experimental WebKit Features' enabled under about://flags.

The labs are built as a series, where the result of one exercise feeds into the next. You will be creating two different layouts, one using FlexBox and one using Grid, that will eventually flow content using Regions and Exclusions.

##01 FlexBox

Build a multicolumn responsive layout using Flexible Box Layout.

##02 Grid

Build a simple two column layout with an image inset using Grid Layout.

##03 Regions

Flow content through the FlexBox and Grid layouts using regions.

##04 Exclusions

Customize the drop-cap for the FlexBox layout, and wrap text around the image inset in the Grid Layout.

##05 Bonus Round

If there is time, create a content template using Shadow DOM.

##06 Results

The final results for both layout exercises.
